# Notes:
# All the numbers for sensors recalibration come from the schematic or linear calibrate.
# If the number is integer or it's 1 decimal place,
# the number comes from the schematic of the board.
# If the number is more than 2 decimal places, we get this value by
# sampling many set of values(read value, real value) and do linear calibration.
